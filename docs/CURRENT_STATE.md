## What exists

- `tools/context_policy.{yaml,py}`, `redact.py`, `repo_query.py`,
  `safe_exec.py`, `safe_test.py`, `safe_diff.py`
- `memory/policy.json`, `tools/memory_store.py`, `tools/memory.py`,
  `tools/agent_session.py`
- Eight durable documents in `docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (import only)

## What does NOT exist yet

`src/sdnguard/domain/identity.py` — `DatapathId`, `PortNumber`,
`PortIdentity` as frozen value types, standard library only.

No controller, no OVS lab, no detector, no policy engine, no feature pipeline,
no model artifact, no AWS lab. The Java Floodlight tree is untouched and is
reference material only (ADR-004).

## Blockers

- **B-1** BLOCKS REAL OVS INTEGRATION ON CURRENT HOST. macOS + Docker Desktop
  cannot provide an observable kernel datapath. It does **not** block the
  Python architecture, domain model, state machine, or any unit/property test.
  Later options: Linux VM, dedicated Linux machine, or AWS EC2 test host.
  Status: OPEN, scoped.
- **B-2** The legacy Java build expects JDK 11; the host has JDK 17 and
  `build.xml` pins `source/target=1.6`. Marked
  `LEGACY_JAVA_RUNTIME_NOT_REQUIRED_FOR_CURRENT_MIGRATION`. Not a blocker; no
  JDK will be installed unless a specific unanswered behavioural question
  requires executing Java. Status: OPEN, not on the critical path.

## Current task

P2-MIGRATION-01 complete. The objective changed by owner direction: the Java
POC is archaeology, not a system to repair. Audit findings are retained in
KNOWN_FAILURES.md and converted into Python design requirements and tests via
PYTHON_MIGRATION_MATRIX.md.

## Exact next action

**P5-OF-01** on branch `spike/p5-openflow-01-framework-selection`: evaluate
current Python OpenFlow options against protocol coverage, Python version
support, maintenance, event and concurrency model, OVS compatibility and
licence, and record an ADR. P4 is complete: the deterministic security core
runs the full chain with no OpenFlow dependency.

# KNOWN FAILURES

Rejected approaches and regressions to avoid repeating.

## Defects found while building the firewall (P0)

| ID | Defect | Why it mattered | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| KF-01 | `\b` word boundary fails after `_` | `SUDO_PASS="…"` — the actual credential in `simulate_attack.sh` — was not redacted | anchors changed to `(?<![A-Za-z0-9])` |
| KF-02 | `/` included in the entropy character class | masked whole file paths, destroying legitimate output | `/` and `.` excluded; require ≥3 character classes and non-identifier shape |
| KF-03 | `safe_exec` echoed the command line verbatim | a secret passed as an argument escaped output redaction | the command line is redacted like any other output |
| KF-04 | allowlist matched raw basenames | `sys.executable` is `python3.12`, so every local Python call was refused | version-suffix normalisation |

## Defects found while building memory (P1)

| ID | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| KF-05 | `_check_quota` measured usage before the metadata write, so a hand-computed boundary was off by one byte | boundary is now measured empirically in the test; store behaviour was correct |
| KF-06 | the lock file counts toward the storage quota, and its payload embedded `os.getpid()` and `time.time()` — both variable-width — so total usage jittered between runs and the quota boundary was nondeterministic (~30% flaky) | fixed-width lock payload; regression test asserts usage is stable across 20 lock cycles |

## Approaches rejected

- **SQLite for the journal** — see ADR-001.
- **Wall-clock cron purge** — forbidden. GC runs only inside a verified
  development checkpoint, never on a timer.
- **Catch-up deletion after an idle gap** — forbidden. A 40-day absence must
  not retire 40 days of memory.
